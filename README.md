# ModLoader-AmongUs
## A small program to automate modifying the game Among Us.

Among Us, the popular social deception game on Steam and mobile devices has been, for many, a salve on the burn of 2020. However, the team developing the game is small, and their [code base is outdated](https://innersloth.itch.io/among-us/devlog/181107/the-future-of-among-us). 

> The main reason we are shooting for a sequel is because the codebase of Among Us 1 is so outdated and not built to support adding so much new content. However, seeing how many people are enjoying Among Us 1 really makes us want to be able to support the game and take it to the next level. We have decided to cancel Among Us 2 and instead put all our focus into improving Among Us 1.

So, in the meantime, many have developed mods for the game. They're mostly serverside, and not hard to install, but due to the game's popularity many players looking for new content and mods might not be technically inclined. That's why I'm building this little app. I chose c# and dotnet 5 (to be upgraded when 6 LTS arrives). I figured .NET would be the best language to build a very accessible Windows app in.
